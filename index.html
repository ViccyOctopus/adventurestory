        <p>Beside a crackling campfire, a motley group of adventurers and mercenaries sat, sharing stories of their exploits. </p>

        <p>Men and women of all ages and appearances jumped to their feet, one by one, each tale more outrageous and
            extreme than the last. Feeling the need to prove myself, I stood abruptly, exclaiming “I have stories
            that put all of your ventures to shame, sit down ladies and gentleman… and listen.” </p>

        <p> Before I could begin to spin my tale, a rustle of cloth caused me to turn my head, where an old,
            battered man stood before me, a finger pointed in my face.</p>

        <p> “Foolish boy, you know nothing of the world, nothing of hardship and survival.
            You have hardly any scars on you! Cockiness will get you killed out there,
            so let me give you a piece of advice: your perspective and
            choices shape how events unfold. These decisions can't be undone,
            so choose wisely. So go on, go make a name for yourself. Maybe
            the next time you find yourself at a fire, you won’t have to lie
            through your teeth about fame and glory.” </p>

        <p> In shock and shame, I sat down. The others quickly resumed their
            story, but I barely heard them. I’d show that silly old man
            what a real adventurer was… </p>

        <p> The next day, I collected my things, stuffed them in a pack
            and set out into the nearby woods. Forests were full of cute
            bunnies and gurgling streams… How bad could it be? </p>

        <p><strong>DISCLAIMER: Decisions made in the story are final - there is no turning back. </strong></p>
